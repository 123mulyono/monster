Bentuk gelap ini disebut bayangan.                      Bayangan berubah tergantung pada cahaya. Jika cahaya dekat dengan benda,                    bayangannya membesar. Jika cahayanya menjauh, bayangannya mengecil. Benda yang                    sama dapat memproyeksikan beberapa bayangan apabila disinari oleh beberapa sumber                    cahaya.                       Benda-benda yang berbeda menghasilkan beberapa jenis bayangan. Cobalah untuk                    membuat bayangan-bayangan menggunakan benda-benda yang terbuat dari beberapa                    elemen yang berbeda. Sorotkan lampu senter ke segelas air, sebuah buku atau jaring, lalu                    perhatikan perubahan dari bayangan-bayangan itu.                                                                                                                                                                                          12/12","This book was made possible by Pratham Books' StoryWeaver platform.
